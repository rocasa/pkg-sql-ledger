Upgrading from version 1.8.4 to 1.8.5

1. install SQL-Ledger over top of your old installation
   $ cd /usr/local
   $ tar zxvf sql-ledger-1.8.5.tar.gz

2. update the tables with the admin script

   You will not be able to log in until you upgraded the tables.


There are two new variables (<%customernumber%> and <%vendornumber%>)
which can be used in the forms. These may be used instead of the
internally generated customer_id and vendor_id.

Typically these numbers are used to retrieve a customer, vendor
by some ID. In most counter operations the phone number is used.
