sql-ledger (2.6.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no change required).

sql-ledger (2.6.6-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Move all files below /usr/share/sql-ledger instead of /usr/lib/sql-ledger.
    This is for better FHS conformance. Thus drop the imagepath patch.
    Modified debian/patches/10makefiles.patch accordingly. Added a NEWS.Debian
    to inform the admin of the change and put a compatibility symlink in the
    mean time. Indirectly closes: #354781

  [ Finn-Arne Johansen ]
  * We now have enough manpower it seem (Closes: #320442)

sql-ledger (2.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Added all CSS files in the "css" directory. Modified
    debian/patches/10makefiles.patch.
  * Added all files from the doc directory except COPYING and COPYRIGHT.
    This includes in particular the various "UPGRADE-*" files.
  * Use hardlinks instead of symlinks. This is better for suExec
    compatibility (on advice from the author). This generates lintian
    warnings. Put overrides until bug 348978 is fixed.

sql-ledger (2.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]

    - fixed notes printing for lineitems
    - fixed path for logo in Default templates
    - updated Brazilian Portuguese translation and templates

sql-ledger (2.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * New upstream version. Closes: #346195
  * Added all members of the team in the Uploaders field (myself included).
  * Build-Depends on debhelper >= 4 since we use debian/compat with level 4.
  * Remove rsync build dependency (seems useless).
  * Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes needed).
  * Wrote plans for the future in debian/TODO.
  * Update 10makefiles.dpatch because new modules have been added in the
    upstream source package. Make it generate the list of modules
    automatically.
  * Reworked debian/rules so that we can have an .orig.tar.gz which is
    the exact copy provided by upstream. Keep dpatch to apply patches
    at build time however.

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #303604)
  * Added debian/watch file to detect new versions.
  * Drop 50norwegian_chart.dpatch as it only insed a duplicate entry
    into the chart file.  (Closes: #300204)
  * Moved the content of 30default.dpatch into 10makefiles.dpatch, and
    moved the files from sql-ledger/etc/ to sql-ledger/ to get the
    sql-ledger.conf files closer to sql-ledger.conf.default.  A future
    improvement is to change this to patch and install
    sql-ledger.conf.default instead of creating a new file
    sql-ledger.conf. Related to bug #296293.
