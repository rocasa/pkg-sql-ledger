sql-ledger (3.2.6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  When upgrading to this version, you need to update your datasets and your
  files manually. Please follow the instructions given at the end of the 
  file /usr/share/doc/sql-ledger/UPGRADE.gz.

  The old Debian only 'latex-cmdline-option' patch does not apply to the new
  upstream and so has been removed and the option that it added is not currently
  available.

sql-ledger (2.8.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The package doesn't do any web-server configuration any more. If you want
  to activate SQL-Ledger, just add a line 
  "Include /etc/sql-ledger/sql-ledger-httpd.conf" in your Apache2
  configuration (probably somewhere in a virtual host in
  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/).

sql-ledger (2.6.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  SQL-Ledger is now installed in /usr/share/sql-ledger instead of
  /usr/lib/sql-ledger. The default apache configuration has been
  correspondingly updated. Please update the path if you have
  other instances configured in Apache. A temporary symlink
  has been put in place to avoid potential breakages, but it will
  be removed one day.
