sql-ledger (2.6.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  SQL-Ledger is now installed in /usr/share/sql-ledger instead of
  /usr/lib/sql-ledger. The default apache configuration has been
  correspondingly updated. Please update the path if you have
  other instances configured in Apache. A temporary symlink
  has been put in place to avoid potential breakages, but it will
  be removed one day.
